## Hack the Northeast 2020
This project was made in 36 hours during the [Hack the Northeast](https://htne.devpost.com/) virtual hackathon.

## Running Locally
Clone this repo, install dependencies using `npm install`, create a `.env` with the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` key for MongoDB Atlas user password. Replace any instances of the google client ID with yours. Configure MongoDB to your liking.

## Technologies
This app was made with **Node.js** and **Express** (with the help of [Fullstack System](https://github.com/davecaruso/fullstack-system/)). **MongoDB Atlas** is the database of choice. **React** was used as the front end framework. **Socket.IO** was used for the realtime functionality of the app. Other dependencies are included in the `package.json`.
